# TAL
Project for the study of algorithmic techniques

The objective of this project was 0-1 (Discrete Knapsack Problem). In this repository I attached some examples of implemenation two kind of alghoritms: exact alghoritm (brut-force alghoritm) and dynamic programming example. 

This repo contains Graphical User Interface implemented using Java Swing to eaes working with this project.
