# TAL
Project for the study of algorithmic techniques

The objective of this project was 0-1 (Discrete Knapsack Problem). In this repository I attached some examples of implemenation two kind of alghoritms: exact alghoritm (brut-force alghoritm) and dynamic programming example. 

This repo contains Graphical User Interface implemented using Java Swing to eaes working with this project.

# Quick illustration of proceeding dynamic programming algorithm 

On this picture you can see a quick example of 0-1 Discrete Knapsack Problem with use of dynamic algorithm. The capacity of knapsack is 7. There are five items in the pool. Each item has its own weight (w) and value (v). The purpose of dynamic algorithm is to take items in order to reach the highest amount of values without going beyond knapsack' capacity. In this example three items (no. 2,4,5) are packed to knapsack and the final value of all knapsack is 10.
